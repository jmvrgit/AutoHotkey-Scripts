# Autohotkey Scripts
This is a collection of AutoHotkey Scripts that I use daily. AutoHotkey is a very useful tool for making stuff simpler and automated.

### Unified Script
The unified script contains all of the ahk scripts combined. If you need only a specific script function, then you may download AutoHotKey and launch the scripts.
## Installation
### Without AutoHotKey
1. Download the latest executable (*.exe) release
2. Run it
### With AutoHotkey
1. Download AutoHotKey
2. Download the latest ahk script (*.ahk) release
3. Run it

## Modifying the scripts
These scripts are highly personal and would require some tweaking to suit your needs.
